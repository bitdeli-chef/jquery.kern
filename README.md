## Introduction

Sprites, IFR, sIFR, FLIR, Cufón, `text-indent: -9999px`, TypeKit ...

From hacks to support to standards to licensing, typography on the web has come a long way.

Unfortunately, aside from getting your `@font-face` onto the damn page, the tools for manipulating and styling your pretty typefaces haven't changed much at all, and browser support for OpenType features still sucks.

Even with solid CSS3 support, you're way behind what you'd get with Photoshop or Illustrator, but responsive design means designing in the browser, and semantic markup means not littering your snazzy display text with styling tags.

Let's start by doing something about that.

## Usage

jquery.kern is a jQuery plugin that traverses the DOM and wraps words and/or characters in semantically classed tags for kerning (and general styling).

It helps you keep your markup clean while using code like this...

```javascript
$('h1.draw-me')
  .addClass('like-one-of-your-french-girls')
  .text('Super sexy text')
  .kern();
```

...to turn pretty code like this...

```html
<h1 class="draw-me">Sorta sexy title</h1>
```

...into fugly code like this...

```html
<h1 class="draw-me like-one-of-your-french-girls kern-kerned">
  <span class="kern-words">
    <span class="kern-word kern-word-super">
      <span class="kern-chars">
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-s">S</span>
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-u">u</span>
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-p">p</span>
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-e">e</span>
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-r">r</span>
      </span>
    </span>
    <span class="kern-word kern-word-sexy">
      <span class="kern-chars">
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-s">s</span>
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-e">e</span>
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-x">x</span>
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-y">y</span>
      </span>
    </span>
    <span class="kern-word kern-word-text">
      <span class="kern-chars">
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-t">t</span>
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-e">e</span>
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-x">x</span>
        <span class="kern-char kern-char-t">t</span>
      </span>
    </span>
  </span>
</h1>
```
...so you can do pretty things like this...

```css
.draw-me {
  font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  text-transform: lowercase;
  font-weight: 900;
  font-size: 72px;
  text-align: center;
}

.like-one-of-your-french-girls
.kern-word:nth-of-type(even) {
  font-variant: small-caps;
  font-weight: 100;
  font-size: 1.04em;
  margin: 0 -.22em 0 -.27em;
}

.kern-word-super +
.kern-word-sexy {
  color: red;
}

.kern-char-s + .kern-char-e { margin-left: -.05em; }
.kern-char-e + .kern-char-x { margin-left:  .02em; }
.kern-char-x + .kern-char-y { margin-left:  .04em; }
```

#### Why don't you [take it for a test drive](http://jsfiddle.net/8XhZk/) and see what it looks like?

By default, it looks at the content after applying `text-transform` and other styles, so your pairs for _AV_ display differently than _av_ without messing with your markup.

Changing this behavior, or any of the other settings, brings us to...

## Options

First, let's go straight to the [fully annotated source](http://github.com/jordansexton/jquery.kern/blob/master/jquery.kern.js.coffee)!

```coffeescript
defaults = # Default settings that can be read/written at jQuery.fn.kern.defaults
  chars:     true      # Wrap all characters
  words:     true      # Wrap all words (successive non-whitespace characters)
  transform: true      # Use nearest CSS text-transform rules for wrapper class naming
  tag:       '<span/>' # Tag for wrapping
  prefix:    'kern'    # Prefix for all class naming (target and wrapper)
  undo:      true      # Undo any previous calls first to prevent double wrapping
  filter:     ->       # Filter content nodes
    @nodeType is 3 and /\S/.test @nodeValue # Include text nodes that are non-empty (contain non-whitespace characters)
# ...snip...
$.extend kern, {defaults: defaults} # Make defaults readable/writable at jQuery.fn.kern.defaults
$.fn.extend {kern: kern} # Expose jQuery.fn.kern for usage at jQuery(<target>).kern(<{options}>)
```

And if [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) isn't your favorite cup of joe, there's always the [traditional flavor](http://github.com/jordansexton/jquery.kern/blob/master/jquery.kern.js):

```javascript
defaults = {
  chars: true,
  words: true,
  transform: true,
  tag: '<span/>',
  prefix: 'kern',
  undo: true,
  filter: function() {
    return this.nodeType === 3 && /\S/.test(this.nodeValue);
  }
};
```

## What's next?

Damn right it does! But don't sell yourself short just yet.

What _you_ need is a **visual editor** for doing this on your own site &mdash; one that can generate reusable, semantic styles for you.

It just so happens that's exactly what's next on the roadmap!

So check out the source, [star the project](https://github.com/jordansexton/jquery.kern/star) if it tickles your fancy, and check back soon.
